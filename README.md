# Kampus-Merdeka_SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language that serves as the standard for data processing in Database Management Systems (DBMS).
There are two groups of SQL commands:

1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
2. Data Manipulation Language (DML): SQL commands used to manipulate objects in the database, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

In this program, SQL training is conducted, where SQL data is connected using sqlite3.connect. Data from the table is displayed using SELECT, and data is modified using UPDATE. Deletion of data is performed using DELETE. Data is displayed based on criteria using WHERE, and data is displayed based on the similarity of specific columns using LIKE.
